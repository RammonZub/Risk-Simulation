The battle.py file defines a Battle class, which simulates a battle in Risk-like game

# Imports and Class Definition:

- import threading: Imports Python's threading module to enable concurrent execution.
- import random: Imports the random module for generating random numbers.
- from shared_resources import shared_lock: Imports a shared lock from a module named shared_resources to ensure thread safety when accessing shared data.
- class Battle(threading.Thread): Defines the Battle class which inherits from Thread, enabling it to run in its own thread.

# Constructor __init__(self, ...):

- Initializes the Battle instance with the attacker and defender territories, number of attacking troops, and the current player.
- Sets various instance variables like the winner, lost troops for both attacker and defender.

# Method run(self):

- The main method that gets executed when the thread starts.
- Calculates attack and defense power using random dice rolls.
- Determines the winner of the battle and calculates troops lost for both sides.
- Updates the game state within a thread-safe block using shared_lock.
- Handles exceptions and prints an error message if one occurs.

# Method calculate_troops_lost(self, attacker_wins):

- Calculates the number of troops lost by both the attacker and defender based on the battle's outcome.

# Method update_game_state(self):

- Updates the troops in the attacker and defender territories based on the battle outcome.
- If the attacker wins, it also transfers territory ownership.

# Method transfer_territory_ownership(self):

- Transfers ownership of the defender's territory to the attacker.
- Updates the list of territories owned by both the old and new owners.
- Adjusts the number of troops in the conquered territory.
# Method print_battle_outcome(self):

- Prints the outcome of the battle, including which player won, the territory involved, and the number of troops lost by each player.

This class encapsulates the logic of a battle in Risk game, handling the combat mechanics, updating game state, and providing output for the battle's result. The use of threading allows these battles to be processed concurrently, which is likely important for the game that has multiple battles occurring simultaneously.

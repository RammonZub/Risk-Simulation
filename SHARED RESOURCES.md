The shared_resources.py file provides a shared resource for the game simulation, specifically a reentrant lock. Plays an important role in ensuring thread safety when multiple threads access shared data

# shared_resources.py
## Import Statement:

- import threading: Imports the threading module, which is essential for working with threads in Python.
## Shared Resource - shared_lock:

- shared_lock = threading.RLock(): Creates an instance of a reentrant lock (RLock) from the threading module.
- A reentrant lock is a synchronization primitive that can be acquired multiple times by the same thread. It's used to ensure that only one thread can execute certain sections of code at a time, thus preventing race conditions and other concurrency-related issues.
- In the context of the Risk game, shared_lock is used to protect shared data structures or resources that are accessed and modified by multiple threads, such as the game board or player states.
